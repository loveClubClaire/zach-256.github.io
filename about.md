I'm Zach Whitten and I'm a professor of Computer Science at J Sargent Reynolds community college in Richmond, Virginia. I received a Bachelor in Computer Science in 2015 from Christopher Newport University and Masters in Computer Science from CNU in 2017. The subject of my masters thesis was an Automated DJ system for independent Internet radio. The idea behind this website is to document various projects I work on. I've programed in a variety of languages including Swift, Applescript, and Objective-C and have apps published on both the iOS and the macOS App stores. I have also done some extensive work with bash for Raspberry Pi projects. Anyone interested in contacting me should send me an email.
